How to upload a kernel on the serial port

# ln -s ttyS0 /dev/tty
# oldcfg=$(stty -g)
# stty litout -cstopb clocal -crtscts raw 115200
# rx /tmp/file ; ret=$?
# stty $oldcfg
...
# echo $ret

Note: the 'rx' utility provided with busybox supports both 128 & 1k blocks
(X and Y modem protocols), as well as CRC, which provides 11 kb/s at a
line rate of 115200 bps with these options on the client :

    /usr/bin/sx -Xbvvo -k
